## Who am I?
I'm a post-graduate student, currently looking to be part of new projects and experiences. If you are hiring, great! Let me know! I am both experienced in front-end and back-end, plus I have a keen eye for design. Besides, I can adapt easily to new chanlleges and I like to work in teams. About my languages skills, I am fluent in portuguese and english, so communication between us won't be a problem.
